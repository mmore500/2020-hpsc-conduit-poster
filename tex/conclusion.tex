Necessity of Best-effort, unsynchronized 
The approach has been the open problem ``open-ended evolution'' within the artificial life community, a topic that has provoked long-term interest around defining, understanding the prerequisites and mechanisms of, and realizing the concept \cite{taylor2016open}.
Recent work has suggested that hardware compute constraints in existing systems meaningfully limit the of artificial life models to exhibit open-ended characteristics \cite{channon2019maximum}.
What a computational system that would allow for open-endedness, with Ackley suggesting a concept of ``indefinite scalability'' \cite{ackley2011pursue}.
Among other considerations, Ackley highlights the necessity of pursuing a best-effort, real-time paradigm in such a system. for reasons that you can't get synchronous to be good for arbitrarily big.
